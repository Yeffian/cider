# Arcade Stats App Submission
---

**Name**: Arcade Stats

**Description**: Arcade Stats is an app designed to allow users to keep track of all their Arcade data, streamlined into one location. Whether they want to keep track of their session history 
for easy scrapbooking, view their total time to share with others, or track their progress towards items that they would like to get.

**How many hours did you spend on this**: 15 hours

**Did you use #arcade to log your progress?**: Yes - partially, about half is missing due to late hour working + no Figma logging :(
