**Name:** Hookd

**Description:** This app is for fishing, more specifically, for detecting bobbers. When you're fishing, you can just leave your phone facing your bobber, open Hookd and start streaming. Then, you can do something else while Hookd watches over your bobber. When Hookd doens't detect your bobber anymore, it sends a notification to your phone and starts beeping to alert you. This fixes the problem of boredom while fishing, and allows you to do other things instead of staring at a bobber for hours at a time.
