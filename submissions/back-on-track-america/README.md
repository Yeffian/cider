Back on Track America (temporary site at https://backontracktampa.wixsite.com/my-site), a nonprofit organization dedicated to

It allows volunteers to sign up for their location, receive announcements from location leaders, and discuss upcoming events.

**How did you build this:** I used React Native and Expo on the frontend to build this app,
combined with [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) and some custom Go logic (at https://github.com/backontrackus/backend)
on the backend. I was a little familiar with React Native before this, but I really learned how to build a complete
cross-platform mobile app while building this. The Expo docs were pretty good, and I used a variety of other packages like
react-navigation and nativewind to make it work.

**How many hours did you spend on this:** 50 hours (according to Wakatime)
