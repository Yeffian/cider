How did you build this: I designed all pages in Figma first, then realized them in SwiftUI (which took waaay longer then expected). I am using a Heroku dyno and postgres through the GitHub Education benefits, with a NodeJS server. New books are fetched from OpenLibrary, and stored in the postgres database. This was my first Swift project, so I had to look a lot of stuff up (love goes out to hackingwithswift.com)
