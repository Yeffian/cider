Name: AstroTask

Description: AstroTask is your space-themed companion for focused productivity and efficient task management. It features two different timers that integrate the Pomodoro technique into your workflow, one for 25 minutes of study, one for a 5 minute break. Both feature a start, stop, and reset button. The main attraction of this app is the ToDo List though. Add a new task using the plus button, delete it by swiping left, and edit it by pressing it. While in edit mode, you can add a description and adjust the priority from low, medium, or high, to display it higher or lower on your list.
