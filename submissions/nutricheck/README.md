**Name**: NutriCheck

**Description**: NutriCheck helps you keep track of your food and activity by providing real-time personalized information based on your nutritional preferences (such as your allergies or preferred ingredients) and body profile (things like your weight or age).
You can search for specific products by name or by scanning its barcode, and the app will provide extensive information, like a Health Score, Match For You Score, nutrients, or allergies.
For activity tracking, you can set up multiple goals to complete, and the app will also provide a daily challenge. There is also a social network present inside the app, so that users can make global or per-product
posts, that can be upvoted/downvoted and commented on.
