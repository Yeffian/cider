# iOS App Submissions

**Name**: Scaffold

**Description**: This is basicaly a second brain app based off [mymind](https://mymind.com/) but a fair bit worse ðŸ˜­; at least its all open source and works offline! You can add links and images to the app and it will tag them and make them searchable with super fast offline search.

**GitHub URL**: https://github.com/kcoderhtml/scaffold

**How did you build this**: I used expo to build this! It was super nice having everyone on slack helping me solve problems and duckduckgo was definetly my best friend during this! I temperoaliy had a backend server written in typescript but gave up on that after realizing a local database would be better. All the data is stored in a giant json store which is a horrible way to do it but thats what I knew when i first made this and I'm not going to refactor everything :)

**How many hours did you spend on this**: 23 hours

**Did you use #arcade to log your progress?**: Yes!
