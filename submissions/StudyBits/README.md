**Name**: StudyBits

**Description**: StudyBits helps you avoid cramming for your exams by allowing you to study on your phone. You can simply subscribe to a course, which will add a set of questions to your question pool. Then, you can answer questions from your question pool by going to the “Answer” tab in the app which will randomly select a question for you to answer. In the future, we plan to implement an algorithm which selectively chooses questions which will maximize your learning in combination with spacial repetition. You might be wondering who creates the questions, well YOU do! To create questions, you simply create a channel and a course with whatever units you would like. Then, you create questions in the create tab to your heart’s content. WE NEED YOU TO CREATE USEFUL COURSES! Right now, all we have is a filler brainrot course, so we encourage you to make usable courses (or courses on how to mew). In the future, we plan to use artificial intelligence to inflate our question sets. Finally, you can use our app to motivate you by competing for a spot on the leaderboard. By answering questions correctly, you gain points which rank you higher on our leaderboard, we plan to make this algorithm more complex in the future. Try to beat the top user who is at 10000003 points.

**Did you use #arcade to log your progress?**: I used #arcade to log my progress initially, but I noticed it reduced my productivity, so the latter half of the project I didn't use it.
