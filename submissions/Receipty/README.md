**Name**: Receipty

**Description**: Receipty is an app that bascially allows you to snap your Reciepts, place them all into one application, add details into them, and then keep them organised. Thing is me and my family recently moved to Abu Dhabi, so my dad was having a hard time keeping his reciepts etc. becuase they WERE SO MANY. So I made this app for him and I found him using it a lot nowadays as it allows him to manage his finances very easily, and all in one place. He prev. used to just store them in files but you know its not as fast as Receipty with respect to adding reciepts on the spot, tags, details, price, date etc. This is what the app is and what problem it solved.

**How did you build this**: Oh, first and foremost did the course on Swift and SwiftUI by Sean Allen, and then just hopped on to make this project. Did not have a lot of experience before. Did breifly work on Swift around 3 years ago but don't recall that much. I will not lie, I also took help from chatGPT and my followers on X (Twitter). I got stuck often and had to do this!

**How many hours did you spend on this**: Idk, took me around a week, few hours everyday.

**Did you use #arcade to log your progress?**: Nope
